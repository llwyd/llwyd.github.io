Hello and welcome to my tech blog.  This is a place where I thought dump about various things I'm tinkering around with in my spare time. I work professionally as a firmware developer but enjoy experimenting with all areas of electronics and computers. I personally believe that knowledge should not be gatekept and should be accessible to all irrespective of background or education. Over the years I've learned _a lot_ from various online blogs and personal websites, so this is me attempting to give something back to the eco system for other people to learn from, hopefully the stuff posted here is useful!

I'm available for ad-hoc work and collaborations should anything here be appropriate, send me an email if so!

Similarly if there are any errors in my posts I'd appreciate being informed about them!
