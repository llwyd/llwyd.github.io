By day I work as an embedded software engineer and sometimes I do outreach at universities to talk about things I work on. I have repurposed a talk I gave earlier in the year at [redacted] university about what to expect when starting out as a firmware developer. The talk was given to final year Electronics engineering and computer science students. All company branding I had to include has been removed.

# What do I do day to day
Below is a short summary of some of the things I do day to day for my job.

- Upfront design of firmware functionality (features)
    - Easier to implement a feature with an upfront design
    - State machine diagrams
    - Timing Diagrams
    - Allows other developers to provide comments
- Implement firmware features (CODE!)
    - Mostly C, occasionally C++
    - Bare metal
        - Other companies may use an RTOS, likely freeRTOS or derivatives.
    - Sometimes model math operations in Python
- Developer testing
    - Use oscilloscope, multimeter etc. to verify firmware
operation is correct
- Fault Finding
    - Use oscilloscope, multimeter etc. to investigate bugs
- Code Reviews
    - Good opportunity to get feedback from colleagues
    - Ensures all developers have a voice
    - Quality control
- Documentation
    - Ensure future developers (AKA you in 6 months time) can understand your work
    - Code comments is usually NOT enough
- Drink a lot of Coffee
    - Important to workplace wellbeing and productivity
- Play Chess
    - Someone brought a chessboard in and we play over the board over lunch sometimes.  We're all equally bad (<1000 ELO)
