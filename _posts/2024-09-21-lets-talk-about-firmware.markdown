By day I work as an embedded software engineer and sometimes I do outreach at universities to talk about things I work on. I have repurposed a talk I gave earlier in the year at [redacted] university about what to expect when starting out as a firmware developer. The talk was given to final year Electronics engineering and computer science students. All company branding I had to include has been removed and there is some light hearted stuff here in an attempt to garner some laughs.

# What do I do day to day
Below is a short summary of some of the things I do day to day for my job.

- Upfront design of firmware functionality (features)
    - Easier to implement a feature with an upfront design
    - State machine diagrams
    - Timing Diagrams
    - Allows other developers to provide comments
- Implement firmware features (CODE!)
    - Mostly C, occasionally C++
    - Bare metal
        - Other companies may use an RTOS (real time operating system), likely freeRTOS or derivatives.
    - Sometimes model math operations in Python
- Developer testing
    - Use oscilloscope, multimeter etc. to verify firmware operation is correct
- Fault Finding
    - Use oscilloscope, multimeter etc. to investigate bugs
- Code Reviews
    - Good opportunity to get feedback from colleagues
    - Ensures all developers have a voice
    - Quality control
- Documentation
    - Ensure future developers (AKA you in 6 months time) can understand your work
    - Code comments is usually NOT enough
- Site visit
    - Go to a customer site and work out what the F is wrong with your system
    - Good opportunity to see how your system is used by the customer
- Drink a lot of Coffee
    - Important to workplace wellbeing and productivity
- Play Chess
    - Someone brought a chessboard in and we play over the board over lunch sometimes.  We're all equally bad (<1000 ELO)

# What to expect at work

- A learning curve
    - Takes time to understand the company’s system(s)
        - At the interview for my first firmware job post-education the software manager told me it would take _2 years_ to learn their codebase and I thought he was exaggerating.  Needless to say he was right, it was insanely complicated and there were still pockets I weren't familiar with when I left just under 4 years later.
    - Can’t be expected to understand the whole system upfront
    - Understanding improves the more time you spend with the code
- Overwhelming amount of jargon
    - What on earth is a:
        - Sprint
        - Agile
        - Retrospective
        - Stand up
        - Kaizen
        - ?????
    - All will become clearer with time
- Opportunities to learn and develop
    - Learn from more senior developers
    - Company supports continued personal development
    - CEng accreditation support
- Very interesting problems to solve
    - Regardless of whether you are working on firmware for washing
machine or an airplane.
- Don’t overthink first job
    - Foot in the door is more important than the “prestige” of company.
    - Smaller firms tend to have nicer hiring processes than big firms
